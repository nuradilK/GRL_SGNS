They just want to focus /- Okay hold on a second /. They just want to focus on another car bomb /. or they just want to focus on some more bloodshed /. Does that issue work that it 's the mainstream media that 's distorting the good news that 's coming out of Iraq /? I think it helps with the republican base /. but I do n't think it helps with swing voters at all /. First of all it 's the nature of news /. I mean on the evening news at night a car that is n't in a wreck is n't in the news /. A house that does n't burn a building that does n't burn a killing that does n't take place /. News is the aberration is the change from normalcy /. Secondly uh eighty journalists so far have been killed over there /. Um I mean I mean getting out there and looking around wandering around Iraq looking for good news sounds to me like a good way to get killed /. And then the third thing is that I do n't know if they really want to try to sell this because people do n't think uh that everything 's fine /. I think this is just an extenuation of holding the banner that says mission accomplished /. The people do n't think it 's well /. They can see that it 's not going well /. And what happens in fifteen provinces does n't matter /. if they think that this thing is just really going to hell in a handbasket um I mean you know that 's that /. David Broder /? The ombudsman at The Post Deborah Howell has a very thoughtful analysis of this question in the paper today which I would refer people to /. I think the answer is that when there is this level of violence and turmoil in a country that has to be the heart of the story that the press is telling /. The other parts of it do get told /. but they do not dominate the news /. and they ca n't dominate the news given the realities of that country /. Nor should they dominate the news /. It 's a very weak argument /. when you have as Charlie said journalists over there who can not move around the country to report because they know that they 're in danger of being killed at any moment that tells you about the state of security in the country /. It 's not good /. The White House /? the other thing that 's interesting what you did n't show was the President 's response to her /. I was there that day /. and he was very very careful not to jump on her bandwagon /. In fact uh I mean obviously he did n't have to /. She did it for him /. but the point is he said look , wait a minute /. You know um I understand your frustration /. but um we have a free press in this country /. We ca n't tell them what to do /. He pulled back somewhat from her comment /. and I think you 're right Charlie that they know they ca n't sell this and when they 've tried in the past it has backfired on them /. But the President also said do n't be afraid to go to blogs and find out some more information /. Yes I mean I mean these are gradations here in White House response /. But is the White House convinced that in order to secure the base of the Republican Party for the President it does n't hurt to go after the media a little bit /? of course not /. They do it all the time /. uh and they complain all the time about what we do /. but I have noticed this past week Scott McClellan saying the White House Press Secretary you know we 're not blaming the media for the war in Iraq /. He said that a couple times this week /. And so again they 're being a little more careful here than usual /. And did you really fall asleep in that press pool /. or was that a cheap shot by the President /? That 's completely inaccurate /. I wo n't say I have n't nodded off in previous speeches but not that one /. There is a difference +between meditation and sleep /. uh David Broder let me turn to the rebellion that I sense with some House members uh particularly in the Republican Party when you go talk to them privately /. You captured it in your column this way /. The conflict over the Dubai Ports World brought to the surface deep - seated resentments from the Capitol end of Pennsylvania Avenue toward the people around the President and surprisingly toward Bush himself /. The harmony that had prevailed during most of Bush 's tenure the deference that a Republican controlled Congress has generally shown to his wishes disappeared /. Even the normal circumspection with which congressional Republicans treat the White House withered in the heat of this dispute /. And then this /. Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia a committee chairman told The Post this is probably the worst administration ever in getting Congress ' opinion on anything /. Ouch /. Well you had heard this kind of comment all of us had privately from Republicans on the hill /. But the fact that somebody like Tom Davis former chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee is saying it publicly on the record uh gives you a measure of the sort of fall - off of any sense of either loyalty or intimidation whatever you want to call it to the White House /. Uh they uh feel that they 're on their own and that the President is going to take care of his business but they 're going to take care of their own /. One of the things being talked about Elisabeth Bumiller is the staff shake - up at the White House /. This is how you reported it /. Republicans outside the White House say that had pushed Mister Bush uh not to replace Karl Rove the chief uh political operator Deputy uh Chief of Staff but rather to bring in someone at the same level or above perhaps as minister without portfolio /. One Republican said Mister Bush should view it as replacing a top - notch pitcher struggling in the later innings of a baseball game rather than as a vote of no - confidence in a friend /. So who 's the reliever /? Well there 's lots of names that they /- You 've heard them as well as I have /. Ed Gillespie uh you know Bill Paxon /. there 's lots of names /. Um the question is are they going to do it /. and right now there 's a lot of talk at the White House /. There 's no indication that the President has signed on to this idea /. Karl Rove has told people that he thinks that bringing somebody in without a clear line of authority is a mistake /. and uh the bottom line is is this going to help with the war in Iraq /? you know you know we 're not talking about changing policies here /. we 're you know changing you know some personnel /. so that 's /- it 's unclear if anything 's going to happen /. John /? Well chances are pretty good something will happen /. The President of course did n't rule out the idea of bringing someone on /. Bill Paxon 's a possibility /. Vin Weber 's also a possibility /. And I think over time you could see some changes in the White House staff as well /. When you look at sort of the big three or the biggest names in the White House Andy Card Karl Rove Dan Bartlett you could see some change over time /. Andy Card probably the most likely to leave at some point /. He 's almost uh already the longest serving Chief of Staff ever /. You could see some change there /. on the verge of dethroning Sherman Adams of Dwight Eisenhower fame /. You bet /. Uh let me turn to the midterm elections where all these things +invariably lead /. Here 's our latest numbers in the Wall Street Journal poll right track wrong track /. United States headed in the right direction twenty - six percent /. One of four /. Sixty - two percent say wrong track /. and the so called generic question who do you want to control Congress /. Republicans thirty - seven percent /. Fifty percent now a majority say the Democrats /. but as always Charlie Cook is warning of us to go slow /. And here 's his latest column from the National Journal /. Despite national political trends indicating that the GOP is in serious trouble a race by race micro-analysis suggests that Democrats can not easily seize control of the House or Senate this fall /. In the Senate Democrats need a net gain of six seats /. Democrats need to win in Tennessee where Bill Frist is retiring have to run the table by defeating all the most vulnerable Republicans while holding all of their own seats including in Minnesota where their incumbent is retiring and in Washington state where Senator Maria Cantwell faces a very strong challenger /. They also need to hang on to somewhat more secure open seats in Maryland and Vermont as well as fourteen other incumbents /. Although not impossible in a favorable political climate this is a very tall order /. and here are the vulnerable states according to the Cook report /. Uh vulnerable senators Conrad Burns in Montana Lincoln Chafee Rhode Island Mike DeWine Ohio Santorum in Pennsylvania Jim Talent Missouri and the Tennessee seat /. Charlie what do you see in the Senate /? you know when you look at this election from the big picture the national numbers boy just looks horrible /. and it looks like gosh Republicans will be lucky if they hold onto anything /. And then you do the race by race like this /. Now the thing is the first three or four for Democrats probably are n't that hard /. But when you get to the fifth and sixth seats you get to winning in Ohio and talking about the Tennessee open seat /. Gosh that 's hard /. I mean it 's going to take a real real real strong wind up their backs /. and it 's the kind of thing where there 's structural barriers /. I mean eighty - five percent of all incumbent senators get reelected /. And you 've got to knock out five of them /? Now it can happen /. but it 's hard /. And it 's kind of like having uh structural barriers that are out there that are protecting the Republican majorities /. and if this is a category one two or three hurricane those barriers are strong enough /. but if it 's a four or five they 're not /. And the question is how tall will it be /. And Tim some of those races can change overnight in a hurry /. Conrad Burns has now got a primary challenge from a significant Republican /. There 's some talk among Republicans that maybe Conrad Burns would find something else to do maybe in the Bush administration /. That could change in a hurry /. Charlie you also say this about the House /. In the House where Democrats need a net gain of fifteen seats only about three dozen are truly in play today /. So it 's tough /. and you have to get an inside straight /. Right there 're basically twenty - four republican seats that today are vulnerable /. Democrats have to win fifteen out of twenty - four and hold on to their eleven the toughest ones /. And again they can do it /. if there were more Republican retirements in tough districts , if uh /- But redistricting and the incumbency advantages that have built over the years just make pulling this kind of win hard unless it 's a category four or five /. Well in nineteen ninety - four you talked about micro-changes thirty to thirty - five seats in the House /. and the tsunami came /. Republicans won fifty - two seats uh electing Newt Gingrich Speaker of the House /. Newt Gingrich has now weighed in David Broder and said that the Democrats ' slogan in two thousand six should be had enough /. And he thinks that would work /. What a helper Gingrich is /. Uh I think the Democrats ' real slogan may very well be would n't you like to have somebody watching the store because the sense that I get from talking to voters is that they are not ready to entrust the government to the Democrats but they 're not really comfortable with the way the Republicans have been running things /. And the simple idea of having a little oversight uh little checks and balances back in the system is potentially a really powerful argument for Democrats /. Elisabeth Bumiller when the White House hears little oversight checks and balances to them it means hearings with subpoena power /. and they do n't like that /. That 's right /. No no /. and you know Karl Rove has told people he 's optomistic they can hang on to both Houses um uh if /- But he also has said yes it can happen the way Charlie Cook says /. And you know you 're going to see the Pre- /- the President 's out a lot these days campaigning already raising money for candidates /. and uh he 's out in all these big states /. Because the last thing the White House wants is investigation into weapons of mass destruction and to prison abuse and to religious rights in Afghanistan /. drop the issue /. and there 's a hearing /. I mean that 's the last two years of the Bush presidency then /. and they know that /. That 's true Tim /. but let 's keep in mind first of all keeping Republican majority is not the top priority for this White House /. Winning the war in Iraq is the top priority /. And secondly it might not be the worst thing to happen to George W Bush if Democrats had a weak majority /. You could see some deals cut especially on entitlement programs the last two years if Democrats try to resolve a problem before they hope they get a president in two thousand nine /. David is it enough for the Democrats to say we 're not the Republicans period /. or do they have to come forward with a specific proposal to deal with these problems including Iraq /? Well if they 're going to be responsible they need some policy /. And the great void on the Democratic side is nobody can tell you today what their policy is about Iraq about entitlements or about any of the other challenges facing the country /. Whether they need that politically somebody else is smart enough to decide /. But if they 're going to be a responsible party they need to talk about policy /. Do they need to do it /? See I would argue that minority parties do n't have to be responsible /. That 's the one good thing going for them /. and when they try to be responsible they 're just going to dig themselves into a hole /. I mean your job is to throw rocks /. Once you start offering alternatives then suddenly you 're playing defense as well /. I think Democrats would be crazy from a political standpoint to offer up proposals /. That movie Cool Hand Luke sometimes nothing 's a real cool hand /. Exactly /. Elisabeth Afghanistan a very thorny issue for this president uh who is uh very open about his Christianity /. and now we have the situation where it appears this gentleman who converted to Christianity in Afghanistan has been spared the death penalty /. But it 's an ongoing issue as Secretary Rice seemed to indicate as that democracy in Afghanistan goes through some serious growing pains dealing with religious rights women 's rights civil rights human rights /. Right well this is what happens when you call for democracy in problematic parts of the world /. We saw this in the elections in the Palestinian territories obviously /. What do you do when you call for democracy and the wrong party wins in your view /? This was also going on in Afghanistan /. Um the president was ver- /- You know you saw him this week saying this was deeply troubling /. Um it would be interesting to know what was going on behind the scenes and what kind of pressure was put on Afghanistan our good ally /. Um obviously uh uh it looks like they got out of this one for now /. John uh Harwood Secretary Rice openly talking about American troop withdrawals /. How much are politicans expecting to have significant troop withdrawals before the midterm elections /? I think Republicans are definitely expecting it and that could change the political environment /. That 's one of the biggest drivers of this wrong track sentiment that we 've been talking about this morning /. Uh but eh as uh uh David discussed Democrats do n't exactly have a clear voice /. They 're going to try to finesse it this week and have an event drawing together all factions of the party criticizing Bush and calling for some sort of transition without specifying exactly how it 's going to take place trying to have an umbrella under which those who want to withdraw troops quickly and those who want to go more slowly can all rally behind /. Is n't that the Republicans ' hope David that by October enough troops have come home the President can then give a speech that says you see /. we 're making progress /. Stay the course /. Do n't take a chance by going on with these other guys and doing something dangerous /. If that happens the Republicans would benefit /. and the country would benefit /. And uh let 's just hope that it 's possible /. Charlie Cook politically will that be enough to deal with people 's anxieties concerns about Iraq /? That would help a lot /. I mean your NBC Wall Street Journal polls show that Iraq was just a wet blanket over the administration /. It was weighing everything down /. And these Republican members one of them told us he comes in for the Tuesday uh House Republican conference lunch and he can tell who 's just gotten a poll back that they have this shell - shocked look on their face /. Somebody else said ashen /. One other member said suddenly they start going into fundraising frenzies because they 're getting polls back in their individual districts that are starting to reflect those national numbers that look so horrible for them /. It 's March madness for congressional Republicans too Tim /. I 'll tell you that /. Speaking of March madness you 're a Duke man /. Who do you like now /? Boy I 'm rooting for George Mason /. that 's the uh underdog pick right now /. The Patriots /. Charlie /? LSU /. I 'm from Shreveport Louisianna /. Shreveport /. Georgetown 's out /. so I 'm for LSU /. David +Broder /? Villanova /. Villanova /. I got my BC hat /. I was ready to wear this for the final four /. but uh uh I /- you know what /. you got to go for big baby Davis /. Elisabeth /? You 're the basketball fan /. whatever you say Tim /. Who 's playing /? I 'm better than that /. Alright you sure are /. Elisabeth Bumiller John Harwood David Broder Charlie Cook we 'll be right back /.
